## What is mongodbschool.io?

MongoDB School is a series of choose-your-own-adventure style workshops with exercises to help you learn MongoDB by writing code to solve realistic problems.

The mongodbschool.io site lists all of the available workshops with suggested core concepts and electives.

## Contributions welcome!

Please help us improve the workshops & exercises (and perhaps even contribute some of your own!).

If you have any updates for the mongodbschool.io site, please feel free to [fork the GitHub repo](https://github.com/braz/mongodbschool.io) or [send us suggestions or improvements](https://github.com/braz/mongodbschool.io/issues) via the GitHub issue queue.

Each workshop lives in its own repository. MongoDB-related workshops include:

 - [Learn You The MongoDB For Much Win!](https://github.com/braz/learnyoumongodb)
 - [Aggregate Adventure](https://github.com/braz/mongodb-aggregate-adventure)
 - [Modelling with Mongoose](https://github.com/braz/modelling-with-mongoose)
 - [Tame the Kraken](https://github.com/braz/tamethekraken)

All workshops are written in Node.js and Markdown using the excellent [workshopper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/workshopper) package created by Rod Vagg.
